Hi, I'm Murad 👋

I build products by focusing on people, not just the tech behind them. As CPO at [Flomni](https://flomni.com/en), I help my team build tools that solve real, human problems.

🚀 My main job is to turn complex challenges into simple plans. I connect the dots between our product goals, our engineering team, and what our users actually need.

✍️ On my blog, I share stories from the trenches—the good, the bad, and the lessons learned while building products, working with AI, and leading teams.

😅 Fun fact: I once built a water cooler that accepted Bitcoin. It was a spectacular failure, but taught me that the most interesting ideas are the ones that make people say, "wait, what?"

I'm best reached by [email](mailto:murad.pmanager@google.com). Always open to a good conversation and collaboration.
