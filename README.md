Hi, I'm Murad 👋

I'm a Chief Product Officer and product builder. I lead the Product and Engineering teams at [Flomni](https://flomni.com/en), where we build useful tools that make life easier for our customers.

🚀 I like figuring out how things work and finding better ways to build them. Sometimes I write code, sometimes I sketch out ideas, and most of the time I'm connecting the dots between people, problems, and solutions.

✍️ I write a lot! This [blog](https://murabcd.vercel.app) is where I share what I'm learning from working with AI and tech, to building products and leading teams. Nothing fancy - just real experiences, ideas, and lessons worth sharing.

😅 Fun fact: I once spent 3 months building a product feature that nobody used, which taught me more about product development than any successful feature ever did.

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:murad@flomni.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations about product, AI, and building things that matter.
