Hi, I'm Murad 👋

I'm a product leader who believes the best products come from understanding people, not just technology. Currently CPO at [Flomni](https://flomni.com/en), where I help teams build tools that actually solve real problems.

🚀 I spend my days at the intersection of product strategy, engineering, and user needs. My superpower? Taking complex problems and breaking them down into simple, actionable solutions.

✍️ I share insights about product development, AI integration, and team leadership on my [blog](https://murabcd.vercel.app). Real stories from the trenches, not just theory.

😅 Fun fact: I once built a water cooler that accepted Bitcoin payments. Because the world wasn't ready for such a revolutionary combination. Sometimes the best ideas make people say "wait, what?"

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:murad@flomni.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murabcd/). Always happy to chat about product challenges, AI opportunities, or just interesting problems worth solving.
